install libraries done with either pip or conda
pip install libraryname

with pip 

pip install namelibrary

or also offline, we download the package, go to the package folder with terminal and use 
pip instll
pip install name of the file
https://conda-forge.org/

will help acess more software to be installed.

when we import a module we can see were it is located we can seewith
pythonpackage.__path__

if we import sys, used to navigate in the system
if we have a package in a ifferent location we need to add
the repository to the ssystem path. using sys.path.append('path of the folder containing the package)
but it is not raccomandable to do that


If the code is not open it is difficult to know and watch if it works.
if in git when was it updated?and how often it happens?

changelog is a filewith the log of every modifications
codecoverage.... it means that the coverag

if we want ot import a package we need to add it to the path


#!/usr/bin/env python
this line is importnt for linux users

if __name__ == "__main__": 
if i call the file need to run that

    parser = ArgumentParser(description="Generate appropriate greetings") a description
    parser.add_argument('--title', '-t')  with dash it is optional parameter
    parser.add_argument('--polite','-p', action="store_true") 
    parser.add_argument('personal') non optional parameter
    parser.add_argument('family')
    arguments= parser.parse_args() this parse all the argument




for the structure we will need to have a big folder (studet ID for the exam)
inside the libary.
the library and other file, setup.py. README (hot to use the program) CITATION (how to cite my work)
