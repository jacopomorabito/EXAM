SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION

Choice of variable name
Choice of comments
Choice of layout

Syntax choices
Camel Case: Class names with upper case, methods lower case
and variables separated with underscore

No raw number but magic number

Better not to allow repeated fragments of code

Better to write clean and selfexplaining cod instead of writing comments

When dealing with long epressions we can create local variables.

Replacing loop with iterator

Replace set of arrays with array of structures. When for instance
a function needs to work corresponding indices of several arrays.

Replace constant with conficguration file

Replace global variables with function arguments

Merge neighbouring loops

Break a large function into smaller units

Separate code concepts into files or modules




DESIGN
Classes
We ought to replace ad-hoc data structures with classes, and replace functions
with methods inside Classes
Replace method arguments with class members if the argument is used a lot of times
